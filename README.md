# Moving Object Detection
 The script reads a video file, applies background subtraction to isolate moving objects, and then uses morphological operations to refine the foreground mask.  It further filters detected objects based on size and aspect ratio to improve accuracy. Finally, it draws bounding boxes around the detected objects in the original video frame and displays the result.
